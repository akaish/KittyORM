### Like KittyORM? Share it!
You use KittyORM and you like it? Share it with those who can use for their projects. That's simple. It is really easy way to help to improve KittyORM, more people use it means more feedback, bug reports or feature request would be received. Bigger community means greater opportunities for KittyORM project and all other projects that use it or would use it for database related operations. 

1. Share your feedback with link to KittyORM page located at [https://akaish.github.io/KittyOrmPages/](https://akaish.github.io/KittyOrmPages/) or KittyORM GitHub repository located at [https://github.com/akaish/KittyORM](https://github.com/akaish/KittyORM) or even link to KittyORM demo application located at Play Market at `TODO add link when ready`. Tweet it, write note on your blog, tell your opinion.
2. Send somebody, for whom KittyORM may be useful, link to the project. Maybe you would help somebody to find ORM for Android that can be excellent for some project.

Too much work to do and do not have any free time even for tweet or PM? Never mind, just share it via "Share KittyORM" button with most comfortable way. Any assistance is appreciated and by sharing KittyORM you help to make it greater. Thank you.
