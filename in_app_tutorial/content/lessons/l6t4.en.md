### Like KittyORM? Sponsor it!
A lot of time spent to develop KittyORM and right now KittyORM is capable to fulfill most of your needs related with implementing database operations to support your business processes. It was hard work to bring KittyORM to you. You can help KittyORM to become more efficient, fast, stable etc. Just use it, share it or contribute to it. However, it would be great if you consider to help KittyORM with voluntary donation. Those donations would stimulate to work on KittyORM harder and would encourage KittyORM authors for implementing new features and help to purchase devices for testing.
