### Use KittyORM in your projects and leave your feedback!
It is very simple to make KittyORM even greater. Just use it in your projects and leave your feedback. Easy as a pie:

1. Visit KittyORM page located at [https://akaish.github.io/KittyORMPages/](https://akaish.github.io/KittyORMPages/) or KittyORM GitHub repository located at [https://github.com/akaish/KittyORM](https://github.com/akaish/KittyORM) to acquire instructions on configuring your project in order to use KittyORM.

2. Implement your business logic without messing with SQL and a lot of boiler plate code for database operations.

3. Leave your feedback, feature requests, questions or bug reports at **Issues** section of [KittyORM project GitHub repository](https://github.com/akaish/KittyORM/issues) or send it to <kittyorm@gmail.com> with subject contains `!feedback`, `!featurerequest`, `!question` or `!bugreport` (optional but it would be very nice).
